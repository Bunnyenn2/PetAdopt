      <p class="Foundertext"> Hello, My name is Scarlett Spicedust, and I'm the founder of DCR. When I got my first Slime at a young age, I was sincerely overjoyed, I love taking my slime on trips and playing with her. When I learned that plenty of creatures were not treated as well as mine, I vowed to help those in need to live full, healthy and happy lives.   </p>

    <p class="Coundertext"> Hi, My name is Cirrus, and I'm the Co-founder at DCR. Ever since I was a little fae, I've been really lucky to be surrounded by those who really shown me the wonders of dungeon creatures. Even now, as I grew up I fell more in love in what they can really offer us warriors. I want to give back and show them the joy of having a best friend.  </p>
